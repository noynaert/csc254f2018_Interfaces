# Abstract classes and Interfaces

This repo is only for a lesson on Abstract classes and Interfaces.  It is
mostly about interfaces.

The initial Committ is for the start of the project.

## Multiple Inheritance

True Multiple Inheritance sounded like a good idea, but it created some very difficul bugs in programs

In C++, the advice is 

* Only inherit from one full class
* If you are going to inherit from two classes
    * All methods must be abstract
    * All data fields should be final and static
    
## Java Interfaces

* Only abstract methods are allowed
* All data fields must be final and static

## Does Java have multiple inheritance?

* It's complicated
* Not really.
